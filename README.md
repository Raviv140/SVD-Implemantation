# SVD-Implemantation
A python implemantation of the Singular Values Decomposition (SVD) 
A pure implemantation without the built-in function from linalg library svd().
The SVD is a remarkable matrices decomposition using to several uses such as :
1) Rigid transformation
2) In machine learning field 
3) In PCA algorithm to reduce number of features . 

## The function it self : 

svd_Implem(A)

takes one argument -> matrix we want to decompose .
